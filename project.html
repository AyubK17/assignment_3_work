					<h2>Project Idea</h2>
					<hr>

					<h3>Overview</h3>
          <h4>topic</h4>
          <p>The main goal of our project is to provide a learning platform called QuickClass, with short courses across a vast range of areas. This learning platform will prompt users to register and create a user profile based on their hobbies, interests and career goals. Students will also be able to input previous courses that they have completed. Based off this information, QuickClass will make recommendations on further courses the student can complete in line with these goals and be assigned a tutor to each course. This tutor will teach and provide support through the learning process and will provide feedback after the final grade on how user went and possible next steps.
          </p>
          <p>This platform will have similar functionality to online study at University, but with short courses that could range as low as 1 to 3 sessions per course. These courses will cover interests and hobbies, career goals, workplace compliance and more. Each subject will have an online content library for the student to access. They may have homework and a quiz at the end to determine if the user has retained this knowledge.</p>

          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>The primary motivation behind this platform comes from the desire to learn, which is the consensus of Team Exodus. There are many ways to learn about every subject matter, but often this information is omni-directional, and may not cater for different learning styles. There are many learning platforms that provide educational videos and quiz students on their knowledge, but near to none offer the support from teachers or tutors. It is important for students to be able to ask questions during the learning process and communicate the areas that they may get stuck on. This process will also allow us to modify our training and make sure that is delivered in the best manner possible. This platform offers that opportunity, without the full long-term commitment of a university or TAFE qualification.
          </p>
          <p>Current trends show that online classes are gaining popularity rapidly, and this shows that there is a share in the market for our platform. If we launched this project in the coming months, it would demonstrate to our current and future employers, our ability to work in a team, work to a deadline and demonstrate our creativity in the process.
          </p>
        </div>

          <div class="card2">
          <h3>Landscape</h3>
          <p>As previously mentioned, there are several online learning platforms that offer short courses. These platforms are referred to in the below table.
          </p>
          <img src="images/landscape.jpg" width="500">
          <p>There are a couple of takeaways from this information, most of these platforms focus on either the creative industries or the Technology and workplace compliance areas. Udemy was the only platform out of this list that offered courses across such a broad range of areas. There was also only one other platform that offered users access to a content library for them to study while completing the courses, which was Go1.
          </p>
          <p>The last category that each platform was assessed was whether there was live tutoring available during the courses. Only 3 other platforms offered such assistance, but to varying degrees. CreativeLive was perhaps the most comprehensive of this group, as when the class is taught live, you can interact and ask questions to the panel while the teacher is delivering the content. This is a great way for the students to interact with the teacher, but this process only happens during the initial livestream. After this point you just watch the playback. Go1 offers email and chat support, telephone support, content curation pre and post completion. Finally, Skillshare offers a discussion board so that you may contact the teacher, but this is not the one-on-one tutoring that may be necessary for some students.

          <h3>Description</h3>
					<h4>Aim</h4>
					<p>The main aim of QuickClass is to provide an online and live learning platform that caters specifically to those that only require short classes to cover specific topics. This is mean filling in a gap in the market for just short online live courses. QuickClass will be able to cater for users who wish to learn new interests and hobbies, such as photography/photoshop. Or to further understand topics they are already familiar with, either professionally or in everyday life. QuickClass will also provide HR and health and safety compliance to any company, in any industry. It will be expected that QuickClass will be available to on computer (both Windows and Mac), all mobile devices and VR to ensure that is fully access able to anyone who has access to any of these devices and an internet connection.
					</p>

					<h4>Goals</h4>
          <h5>Create a plan</h5>

					<p>As this project is ongoing over months or years, having a clear and well thought out plan is extremely important. This plan should clearly outline all the features we hope to add to our website and how we intend to assemble all other items (Teachers and internal equipment). This would also outline the minimum number of unfilled roles within the company that would be required to complete this project. This Goal has been listed as most important for many reasons, first, as we intend to gain external funding via different revenue streams, being able to present a full plan of what we hope to achieve and how we plan to do it will inspire confidence in possible investors. The second reason having an appropriate plan is important, is because if the project gets delayed or put on hiatus for any reason, we would be able to resume where we left off. This also works for when we bring on new staff members, as they will need to be brought up to speed on the overall objective.

      <div class="card2">
					<h4>Qualified Teaching Staff</h4>
					<p>The teachers employed by QuickClass will be real educators who are professionals in what they teach. They will have a high understanding and be qualified in the courses that they are teaching. This will involve a screening process, similar to a job interview and will guarantee that the teaching staff employed by QuickClass are qualified and provide the best possible education for the students. </p>
					<h4>Enrolment</h4>
					<p>Enrolment will be done through the home page of the site. The course that a student wishes to enroll in can be found through a search bar. This will allow for a smooth experience in finding the courses any individual would like to take part in. The overall aim is for a smooth experience in the presentation and this is extended to finding the courses to enroll in. There will also be commonly enrolled in courses on the home page as advertisements to give potential direction to those who are not sure on what they are hoping to enroll in.</p>
					<h4>Payment</h4>
					<p>Courses can be purchased in a couple of ways. The first is for personal accounts. A user with a personal account will be asked to make a payment of 20% of the course’s total cost. This is to ensure a guarantee that if a course has been allocated to several people there is already a commitment to the course. If a person does not show up to this course then the money will not be refunded unless that individual reaches out to QuickClass and makes a formal request for a refund. In situations like this there will be compassionate understanding of situations and a refund can be made. Upon completion of the course the rest of the total course cost will be asked to be paid in full, through lump sum or through payment plan. This payment plan will alleviate some of the costs to those who may be financially unable to commit to a full lump sum when the course enrollment is due.<br>
					The other payment method is for those with an enterprise account. This is meant for a workplace enrolling members of their staff in a course. These charges will not go to individuals and will instead be sent as a lump sum to the organization who will be required to make a payment in full. This is to ensure a serious commitment from the company.</p>
					<h4>Types of Accounts</h4>
					<p>There are two different account types for users of QuickClass. Personal accounts and Enterprise accounts.<br>
					Personal accounts are those used by the general public to enroll in courses. These can be linked to multiple services such as Facebook and Google Accounts. The personal account is designed to allow an individual to enroll in the course of their choosing, from anything to a hobby they are interested in, to a skill they are hoping to learn.<br>
				</div>
        </div>

        <div class="pageFrame2">
				<div class="card2">
					<p>Enterprise accounts are set up by companies and registered under their company name. They are able to add multiple users to these accounts under the one company and enroll more than one person in the same course. This allows for a company to easily manage and allocate staff to do certain courses. If a person a staff member is not required or unable to complete a course then they do not need to be signed up and the company can ask for a number of courses making sure that if they want their staff to attend the course enrollment is as smooth an experience as possible.</p>
					<h4>Types of Courses</h4>
					<p>QuickClass will offer a range of courses to users. These can include certificates used to further personal development like First Aid and Occupational Health and Safety, to courses designed around hobbies such as Playing Chess or Photography. A wide range of courses will be included with teaching staff enthusiasm and inspiration at the forefront of the learning. The courses designed around personal development will be primarily advertised to companies seeking training for staff, whilst the courses more related to hobbies and personalized skills will be advertised on personal accounts. The courses designed to be more personalized and individual focused will be ranging from multiple levels such as beginner, intermediate, and advanced, meaning if someone was hoping to learn a language and understood the basics, they could enroll in an intermediate course more suited to their needs.</p>
					<h4>Course Completion</h4>
					<p>Upon completion of a course that requires a certificate, a certificate of completion will be emailed to that accounts registered emails. For personal accounts, this will be their preferred email, however for enterprise accounts these will be emailed to the registered email of each individual employee that has been provided by the company through their account details. This will allow each staff member to acquire their certificates individually and forward them to whomever they feel appropriate. This way the company can arrange the completion of courses for their staff in a manner they deem suitable.<br>
					For courses that do not require a certificate, an email will still be provided with an acknowledgment of completion, to give the user the satisfaction of being told they have done something and can be proud of their achievement.<br>
					If the required work did not meet the teachers' standards and requires adjustments then the email will not involve a certificate or acknowledgment of completion but will instead show the user that they need to adjust their work and they are able to re-submit, or email their course teacher for clarification and specific feedback. This will be enforced on all courses but more strictly when certificates of completion are involved as courses requiring certificates will need to be completed with competency and set criteria to avoid legal issues when stating that an individual has an understanding of a specific area. For courses resulting in acknowledgement of completion, the decision to adjust work will be up the discretion of the teacher and whether they feel the participant has a sufficient understanding.

			<div class="card2">
				<h4>Funding</h4>
				<p>As this is an educational program, requiring the employment of teaching staff, government funding can be requested to launch the site. This will come under the Victorian State Government Department of Education, as the state government is responsible for tertiary funding for schools, and other educational organizations. Teachers' payment, Management, and IT support costs will come from enrollment, similar to the way a schools payment structure works. NCCD can be contacted for student specific funding that QuickClass would need to organize.</p>
				<h4>Algorithmic Based Recommendations</h4>
				<p>QuickClass will aim to incorporate an algorithmic system in order to discern what a person’s study preferences are. This will involve a quiz upon starting a profile asking for details such as what industry the person works in, what hobbies they currently participate in, and what hobbies they have an interest in learning. With this information, courses with similarities will be recommended to the user to guarantee they are gaining the most from their learning on QuickClass. As the users change interest QuickClass will be able make new suggestions based on recent searches and recently participated/watched classes.</p>
				<h3>Tools + Tech</h3>
				<p>QuickClass site will be created on PHP and SQL database for Back End Development. We will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the Front-End application. For site design we will use Bootstrap elements and codes. Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework. The main tool for programming is Microsoft Visual Studio - an integrated development environment from Microsoft. Another tool for connect SQL database and PHP code is XAMPP. XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages.<br>
				Live Interaction Sessions will be possible through popular programs like Zoom, Discord or built-in module in internet site. User could choose which application convenient for him for communication with teacher.<br>
				Payment process will be organized with APIs of finance companies or banks to build payment terminal in our website. Good example of that possible to find on <a href="https://developer.fisglobal.com/" target="_blank">https://developer.fisglobal.com/</a><br>
				To create an application for smartphones on iOS, one of the main languages of iOS development will be used Objective-C or Swift. The Android application development will be developed in Kotlin, which is an enhanced Java. To create applications in Kotlin, we need to have Android Studio 3.0 or later installed.
			</div>

			<div class="card2">
				<p>Elements of machine learning will be applied in our program.  Тhe algorithm of our program will predict with a certain accuracy what exactly the user will want to study next time.  Based on this assumption, the user will be offered a particular course or training videos.  Machine learning is increasingly being used in modern programs and we will develop this algorithm for our program.  The development of code for machine learning will be done using Google's machine learning framework - TensorFlow and Python.  We will create a software that will interact with the user and the user will have the impression that he is working with hight level of artificial intelligence.<br>
				The hardware we will use are a powerful computer, preferably two screens for comfortable coding. To develop applications for smartphones, we need to use an Android smartphone and another iOS smartphone. An internet connection is also required.</p>
				<h3>Skills</h3>
				<p>The Skills required setup and maintain a website and mobile application are extremally varying. The fundamental skills to set up and maintain a website are coding in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As shown in the burning glass data analysis website production and programming languages like JavaScript are in extremely high demand, make possibly difficult to obtain highly qualified individuals to fill these positions. <br>
				As this is a completely web-based program that is for both teachers and students have highly trained technical support staff from level 1 through to operational management positions will be highly critical to continuing positive user engagement. While Technical support might be in high demand, this is a broad term from many different positions so finding skilled working for each sub-category should not be difficult.<br>
				While finding the back-end hardware required to run and maintain our servers and data should not be difficult as there is a large verity of vendors from HP, Dell and more unknown ones like Nutanix, that can provide hardware. We will be keeping it all on premise, there will be no cloud storage as part of our setup. It might be more difficult to find a full stuff of server and network administrators to install and maintain all the hardware.
				<h3>Outcome</h3>
				<p>Ultimately, QuickClass would be designed, implemented and deployed as a web based ‘app’. Because it is web based, it can be accessed by any device with an Internet connection and will therefore be device agnostic. Users will have the satisfaction of accessing a variety of courses led by qualified teaching staff at a time that is convenient to them. QuickClass gives a bit more of a personalised learning platform, allowing their users the ability to ask questions to their teachers, have courses suggested and attune to their interests and needs based on AI algorithm, get feedback from course work and gain course completion to add to their CVs and resumes if they wish as.</p>
