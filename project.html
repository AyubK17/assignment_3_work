					<h2>Project Idea</h2>
					<hr>

					<h2>Overview</h2>
          <h3>topic</h3>
          <p>The main goal of our project is to provide a learning platform called QuickClass, with short courses across a vast range of areas. This learning platform will prompt users to register and create a user profile based on their hobbies, interests and career goals. Students will also be able to input previous courses that they have completed. Based off this information, QuickClass will make recommendations on further courses the student can complete in line with these goals and be assigned a tutor to each course. This tutor will teach and provide support through the learning process and will provide feedback after the final grade on how user went and possible next steps.
          </p>
          <p>This platform will have similar functionality to online study at University, but with short courses that could range as low as 1 to 3 sessions per course. These courses will cover interests and hobbies, career goals, workplace compliance and more. Each subject will have an online content library for the student to access. They may have homework and a quiz at the end to determine if the user has retained this knowledge.</p>

          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p>The primary motivation behind this platform comes from the desire to learn, which is the consensus of Team Exodus. There are many ways to learn about every subject matter, but often this information is omni-directional, and may not cater for different learning styles. There are many learning platforms that provide educational videos and quiz students on their knowledge, but near to none offer the support from teachers or tutors. It is important for students to be able to ask questions during the learning process and communicate the areas that they may get stuck on. This process will also allow us to modify our training and make sure that is delivered in the best manner possible. This platform offers that opportunity, without the full long-term commitment of a university or TAFE qualification.
          </p>
          <p>Current trends show that online classes are gaining popularity rapidly, and this shows that there is a share in the market for our platform. If we launched this project in the coming months, it would demonstrate to our current and future employers, our ability to work in a team, work to a deadline and demonstrate our creativity in the process.
          </p>
        </div>

          <div class="card2">
          <h2>Landscape</h2>
          <p>As previously mentioned, there are several online learning platforms that offer short courses. These platforms are referred to in the below table.
          </p>
          <img src="images/landscape.jpg" width="500">
          <p>There are a couple of takeaways from this information, most of these platforms focus on either the creative industries or the Technology and workplace compliance areas. Udemy was the only platform out of this list that offered courses across such a broad range of areas. There was also only one other platform that offered users access to a content library for them to study while completing the courses, which was Go1.
          </p>
          <p>The last category that each platform was assessed was whether there was live tutoring available during the courses. Only 3 other platforms offered such assistance, but to varying degrees. CreativeLive was perhaps the most comprehensive of this group, as when the class is taught live, you can interact and ask questions to the panel while the teacher is delivering the content. This is a great way for the students to interact with the teacher, but this process only happens during the initial livestream. After this point you just watch the playback. Go1 offers email and chat support, telephone support, content curation pre and post completion. Finally, Skillshare offers a discussion board so that you may contact the teacher, but this is not the one-on-one tutoring that may be necessary for some students.

          <h2>Description</h2>
					<h4>Aim</h4>
					<p>The main aim of QuickClass is to provide an online and live learning platform that caters specifically to those that only require short classes to cover specific topics. This is mean filling in a gap in the market for just short online live courses. QuickClass will be able to cater for users who wish to learn new interests and hobbies, such as photography/photoshop. Or to further understand topics they are already familiar with, either professionally or in everyday life. QuickClass will also provide HR and health and safety compliance to any company, in any industry. It will be expected that QuickClass will be available to on computer (both Windows and Mac), all mobile devices and VR to ensure that is fully access able to anyone who has access to any of these devices and an internet connection.
					</p>

					<h3>Goals</h3>
          <h4>Create a plan</h4>
					<p>As this project is ongoing over months or years, having a clear and well thought out plan is extremely important. This plan should clearly outline all the features we hope to add to our website and how we intend to assemble all other items (Teachers and internal equipment). This would also outline the minimum number of unfilled roles within the company that would be required to complete this project. This Goal has been listed as most important for many reasons, first, as we intend to gain external funding via different revenue streams, being able to present a full plan of what we hope to achieve and how we plan to do it will inspire confidence in possible investors. The second reason having an appropriate plan is important, is because if the project gets delayed or put on hiatus for any reason, we would be able to resume where we left off. This also works for when we bring on new staff members, as they will need to be brought up to speed on the overall objective.
          </p>

          <h4>Funding</h4>
          <p>Funding is an integral part of starting and maintaining a business. As the project of QuickClass is still in its infancy, funding is one the major priorities that needs to be focussed on. This is not only to gain the necessary funds to bring the project up and running, but also to continue, and improve the project after completion of the start-up plan. The aim for QuickClass’ funding is to have a 50% crowdfunded approach to the amount needed to launch our site and bring our project to a reality. The other 50% will come from investors. Continued funding after this could potentially come from the government as we are an educational service. If this funding does not workout however, there is subscription fees that could be used to gain the necessary funds for the continuation of the project.
          </p>
        </div>



      <div class="card2">

          <h3>Crowdfunding</h3>
          <p>The crowdfunding side of things is a large portion of our funding as we are a start-up business with only a few members. Crowdfunding is a valuable resource for many small business’ as it allows the potential interest of the public to fund the project and motivates the businesses to reach goals as they have an incite of how interested the public is on the product or service they hope to deliver whilst allowing business operated plans and progression. This will give the team working on the project a comfortable and relaxed timeline allowing for change. Crowdfunding is also a great way to generate interest, as sites like Kickstarter and GoFundMe are popular among people excited to learn, create and explore new ideas. This philosophy aligns with what QuickClass is, as we are hoping to bring new experiences and opportunities to those using our services. Another reason crowdfunding is a major source of our income during our planning stage is that crowdfunding allows intermittent goals that can be updated as funding is either over or under the expected donations. There are many benefits to crowdfunding a project and their systems in place to keep a business from backing out, so it is reliable and safe to use as a funding option
          </p>

          <h3>Investor Backing</h3>
          <p>Investors are used as another major source of funding for QuickClass. An investor is a potentially wealthy benefactor who puts some of their own capital into a project in order to potentially gain a percentage of profits in return. The reason we have chosen to use investor backing is due to the quick funds they gain allowing a set amount of money to be given to a project and letting the development team understand what they must work with. Whilst this does eat into potential profits after development of the project is complete, it is still a great idea as this has the potential to create much larger profits, that even with the percentage taken from the final revenue can be awarded to the company on a bigger scale. This is because the development team has the funding required to create a high-quality product or service allowing a better public to vote on quality with their wallet so to speak. These benefits led to the team choosing to use investor backings to create the necessary funds needed in order to get the project started.

          <h3>Hire experts in various IT fields </h3>
          <p>While our current team has been the think tank that has brought this concept of a learning platform to life, including a full in-depth written plan of how the website is to function and present interactive visual representations of what we envision the website look like. We alone are not experienced enough to be able to full implement all the features we want this website to contain. For this we will be focusing on hiring senior and highly experienced individuals in the fields of programming, artificial intelligence/machine learning, IT operations management, and media content creating. These roles will be key to implementing features into the website and bringing clients onto the platform. The reason this role sits as third in the priority order is that we will require full funding to pay the wages and a plan of what we need done before we know what roles to fill. This also needs to be done before we can move forward as some of these roles are critical to following goals.
          </p>

          <h3>Buy and build all the back-end equipment</h3>
          <p>Once we have our funding and employees who have the high level of experience in IT systems, both hardware and software, we will be able to order and install all our on-premise equipment. These include servers for hosting our website and substantial amounts of data storage of all recorded classes. This will also mean installing all software that we can keep onsite. While not all components of our IT equipment can be kept local, as many software developers are moving to Software as a Service (SaaS), we intent to keep as much onsite as possible. This includes 1 level of full backups, there will be one full site backup kept in the cloud for security purposes. This Goal sites in at fifth as it requires both high investment cost and the experience to be able to efficiently bring together all the backend IT equipment.
          </p>

          <h3>Build a network for trained teachers in various fields to provide content </h3>
          <p>This goal will be the longest and always ongoing, we will be looking for a people who are experts in their respective fields. These individuals will be acquired via various methods. As these people need only provide one or two classes a week plus marking tests, we will be able to reach out to people who need to are looking to supplement their current work and/or out of state/country as these are all online classes. We can hire teachers directly as full-time permanent employees or we can reach out to those that would like just short-term contacts. We will be advertising our openings for teachers on all major job posting websites and have a careers page on the website. This Goal can be placed at any point after we receive funding as the hiring process can take a long time particularly with as many roles we hope to fill.
          </p>

        <h3>Build a website</h3>
        <h3>User should be able to interact with the teacher in a live and thru feedback. </h3>
        <p>The single most critical component to this project and website is for the user’s to be able to interact with the teachers in real time across various features. Our whole market that this project is trying to corner sits between conventional short online learn courses such as linking learning or Go1, and full scale online higher education such as services provided by Open Universities Australia though various educational institutions. This market is providing complete online live classes that run for short periods of time. This is designed to allow students in classes to interact with the teacher in real time, letting students ask question for more clarification, provide on the spot understanding by answering questions by the teacher. During the live classes, the interaction from the students can be via voice or text chat. another kind of interactions that can be had between students and teachers will be though online test, quizzes, or exams given and marked by the teachers. This will provide a full accredited result and will slow for feedback to the students with their marks on where they could make improvements. The final component that allows for interaction been student and teacher will be 1-on-1 tutoring sessions a student can apply for if they require extra assistance. This goal is considered the most critical as this is what separates this project from other online learning platforms.
        </p>

        <h3>User should be able to search by tags, search terms or popular courses.</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center;">

        <img  src="images/search.jpg" width="300">
      </div>
      <p>As required with fully functioning website we do not intend to have all courses on a single page for the users to sort through themselves. There will be a home page that will a few recommended that most closes reflect your use on the website and there will be a list of most popular courses overall. If a user wants to look up any other courses, they will do this Via a search bar located at the top of every page. This search feature will be able to search by names of courses and by associated tags that will be assigned to courses. Tags will include the name of the course, common associated word with the topic and the length of the course. After doing any search, the content displayed would be able to be sorted by various categories such as, length of course, most popular, featured and most relevant. This feature is a requirement to ensure that the website does not become a single page with hundreds of options, this goal has been ranked second to ensure that QuickClass is user friendly.
      </p>

          <h3>User should experience recommendations</h3>
          <p>One of the main goals for this project is to be able to implement a full machine learning algorithm that can assist users find new courses in their desired field. This will be implemented in various parts of our website, the first and most key component to the algorithm is a quiz when first signing up for the website. This quiz will ask a large variety of multiple choice and dropdown questions to help assign the user with recommended courses that are most closely related to their interests. Another component to the machine learning is to monitor all searches on the site and record all the watched course videos. This will allow the website to show different recommendations if the user starts watching videos not based on the original quiz. Of our currently recognised goals the implantation of machine learning to make recommendation for courses sits at third as while this is a key vision for the website, this only adds to the user experience but does not take away the basic functionality of the website.
          </p>

          <h3>Ability to record and sessions video, audio and written components</h3>
          <p>Part of our project scope is to have the functionality to provide a cheaper option to some users who do not feel the need to patriciate in live classes or do not need an accredited certificate at the end of the study period. This will be done by recording live classes and loading them to a video library that can be accessed by anyone. Students will also be able to access any documents that were provided with the original live class such as quizzes or fact sheets but will not be able to submit them in, or request clarification where required. Students who access this level of learning will also be able to read typed messaged in the text chat for the class but will not be able type new massages. This has feature has been ranked fourth because while this would be a powerful addition for users who are looking to just learn new skills the same way they might on YouTube, our focus is for those that require the live classes.
          </p>

        <h3>Learning via different medium types</h3>
        <p>While at the start having just a functioning website is great, our focus will be on being able to provide our learning platform across many different media types, including full support on Microsoft windows, Apple MacOS, Google Android, and Apple iOS. This will allow us to reach out to as many people as possible, as some people might only have access to a tablet or phone at certain times of day. Our project is designed to be as user engaging as possible that is why we would like to also set the goal of adding VR as a media type, with sales of VR world-wide on the rise and predicted to continue to do so (Aslop, 2021), it makes sense for us to follow the rise in innovative technology and allow our platform to engage with users is new and exciting ways. As important as being able to connect students to teachers in a large variety of ways, this Goal has been ranked last for building our website because it should be that we have all our key features functioning correctly before added them to a new platform.
        </p>
      </div>

    			<div class="card2">
            <h3>User should be able to list as a credential on their resume or job profile </h3>
            <p>QuickClass is an online learning platform, this is to not only educate students but to also provide the students with the ability to provide evidence of their education in a way that is recognised at the least nationally but in some cases also internationally. With full recognition from TEQSA (Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency) students will be able to add all completed courses to their CV for future or current employee to accept as completed. With an international recognition QuickClass can entice students from overseas to participate as well, widening our total intake of students. This goal has been placed in the second last in overall goals, this is due to our focus to provide a high-quality user experience with the students and to be able to deliver on the promised features. This is also because to become accreted in a subject as we need to prove that we can provide on the requirements.
            </p>

            <h3>Donation sections </h3>
            <p>Innovation may not be just technological, but organisational and managerial, economic, marketing, social, ecological, and so on. We decided to introduce innovation, which in our opinion is very important in modern society. This innovation consists in the fact that if our client donates on our website, then depending on the amount of donation, he will receive a free course or several free courses. A donation of $ 15 will give the opportunity to receive one free course and technical support. A donation of $ 40 or more will be rewarded with 3 courses to choose from wide range of courses. In addition, in gratitude, we will send you a coffee mug with the logo of our site. We hope that our innovation and all donations to charitable foundations will make our world kinder and more beautiful!
