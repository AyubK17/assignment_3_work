					<h2>Scopes and Limits</h2>
					<hr>
						<p>As many different start-ups are formed from garages to Silicon Valley and even tech students at RMIT one thing that many if not all have in common is the amount of time allocated towards building projects which is a vital step in ensuring that teams finish their work on time and on budget. Before a plan can be developed, everyone needs to know what needs to be done. As defined by the project management Institute the project team must define the constraints that will affect the project’s success. The list of assumptions that the team must make in order to overcome these constraints are to define the boundaries of the project which for the scenario of exodus group in building QuickClass is to be aware of the time, resource and experience limitations within the group to complete the entirety of the project but choose to focus on the finer details of the project to be able to show to investors a working prototype to gather funding for further development if needed. Furthermore, key milestones will be implemented which are steps that stakeholders and beta version of the project that consumers can expects to see a particular deliverable completed, such milestones can also include specific steps that are necessary to complete a project.</p>
						<p>Although the limitations to do with time constraints and experience of group members have been outlined, there are various milestones that can be achieved where within the 6 weeks mark a fully functioning website can be developed. However, due to limitations the QuickClass would not have fully functioning ready classes but short videos of each group member to show that the concept works and can further be developed. The main deliverables that will be taken precedence over the others would be the backend function of the project these including the layout of QuickClass to make sure that within the constraint time period that as much of the physical website is formed to make way for further funding and time to be allocated towards it. There are many suggestions given but a SWOT analysis to be formed would not be a bad idea to make sure that the main components are covered any opportunities to be leveraged and any liabilities to be halted to progress with the project. </p>
