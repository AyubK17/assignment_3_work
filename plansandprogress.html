					<h2>Overview</h2>
          <h3>topic</h3>
          <p>QuickClass aims to be a learning space for anyone seeking education, whether for personal hobbies or certificates required for work. QuickClass will be a browser-based website and will have app support downloadable from the homepage. QuickClass aims to give short comprehensive classes that are easy to attend, with sufficient support for those who require it. These courses will be shown through in-depth demonstrations with tutors who are passionate, knowledgeable and qualified to teach the subject they are providing education for.</p>
			<p>For many students, this will be an easy and comfortable environment where their schedule will line up with the courses that they are participating in. The support will come from tutors in live sessions one on one with the students organised and agreed upon from both tutor and student. The tutors will also give out assignments and homework to ascertain a student’s aptitude for a particular subject.</p>
			<p>The courses provided by QuickClass are the main driving force behind the motivation and presentation of the website. The development team will focus most of their attention on this as it is the most important feature. The courses will be presented through live online interactive sessions and recorded sessions for courses not requiring live sessions. The courses will be easy to attend as they will have schedules planned for those with full time work or other commitments. QuickClass courses will be designed to fit into 6-hour time frames, with a 12-hour maximum homework component. While courses are designed to fit within these time constraints, they are not required to meet them and many courses will be able to be shorter than this. These 6 hours can be broken up and spread over time to maintain a schedule for people with commitments that may not lend them the time to complete a full course otherwise. QuickClass aims to use video recording, editing and sharing software to allow these courses to be uploaded from tutor specific accounts, whilst also incorporating this into their live classes.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="card2">
			<p>Tutors will be screened and contracted by QuickClass at an hourly rate equivalent to that of a teacher’s salary. This is to promote fairness between onsite education and QuickClass’ education in accordance with government laws around funding. QuickClass aims to have one on one sessions for students who require where a messaging system inside of QuickClass can be used to protect the privacy of both tutors and students. Tutors will provide live classes for people who are able to attend and record these classes for those who are unable to. These sessions could be set up through other applications such as Zoom, Discord or through the site itself, allowing for flexibility in learning for the student and a comfortable environment that can be shared by multiple parties that prefer the out of site options.</p>
			<p>QuickClass will be created as a browser-based website in order to keep access easy to use and familiar with people who are less technologically savvy as the development team. An application will also be made available for download to allow students to access QuickClass from their devices at any time. This is to keep in line with QuickClass’ goal of pressure free timetables that accommodate the business of any individual’s schedule.</p>
			<p>The website will be comprised of primarily HTML, JavaScript and CSS. This is due to the development team’s familiarity with those coding languages. The website for QuickClass will be easy to use and incorporate elements of machine learning. This will be used to help distinguish exactly what a student hopes to gain from QuickClass. The students will be offered a quiz that they can participate in to help our algorithm gain an understanding of what that student is interested in. It is then up to our machine learning system to provide suggested courses that fit this persons interests, for example if a student was interested in music, they could be provided a course about learning a particular instrument. There will also be some outlier options given to the user to pique their interest in learning about other topics they may not have considered yet. If nothing were to come up for that particular student, then a search bar will also be included in our sites page to find the a course perfect for their studies. This can also be done for corporations, however their suggestions will be certificates based around job requirements.</p>
			</div>
			
			
			<div class="card2">
			<p>Multiple account types will be used within QuickClass to help differentiate who needs to learn what. For corporations and businesses hoping to gain certificates for their workers as job requirements, an Enterprise account is suited to that business owner. This will allow them to easily add their employees to the courses of their choosing.  For more student specific courses a Personal account will be perfect as they are able to use this to enrol in an assortment of courses. Tutors will also have their own specific accounts that will have video uploading and sharing included whilst also having payment and rights given to those tutors so that they know the content they make is secure and protected.</p>
		      
		
          <h3>How was Quickclass chosen as a project</h3>
			<p>QuickClass was chosen as the project being worked on by the development team. There were multiple options that the group were deliberating as a project idea. The options were narrowed to 5 with a vote being cast on which to further. After the votes there were two options that the group were struggling to decide between, and those options were a website dedicated to providing education to people through online classes with an emphasis on short and easy to manage classes for those with busy schedules. The other option that was up for furthering was another educational system integrated into games. Whist the educational website was overall the final decision, it is clear to see that the team has a passion for educating others, allowing us to be passionate and work cohesively together on the idea that was to become QuickClass.</p>
          <h3>What progress has been made so far</h3>
			<p>The development of QuickClass has been mostly planning. We have planned and collaborated together as a group to really understand what we are implementing in QuickClass. </p>
			<p>Whilst the planning phase and outlining the features of the website has been the majority of the work done so far the group has been working behind the scenes writing a script for a video promoting QuickClass and marketing the idea to the parties that are interested. </p>
			<p>The group has started making some effort towards creating a site using GitHub. The GitHub is being used to create and collaborate on the website by the team, who are all contributing to the look and feel of the website. This is where much of the work will be focussed going forward to the immediate future as QuickClass is a website. This is primarily due to having a website that is running effectively enough to show what can be achieved and what is being worked on is our main concern. </p>

		  <h3> What information would someone need to continue this project </h3>
			<p>Our project is still in its infancy in terms of implementation. We would need a team of web developers, machine learning specialist and end user testers for the project to be deemed completed and ready for public use. </p>
			<p>The web developers will have access to our team minutes, recordings and git hub repositories to access HTML, Javascript and CSS code. Each member of the team can work on different artefacts on our website based on our detailed description of this document which contains aims and goals. </p>
			<p>As none of Team Exodus team members have machine learning or AI algorithm programming skills. We would need to hire a specialist(s) to help advise, plan and implement how it will work with our website and what algorithms we need to fulfil one of our goals for the website to suggest courses that are relevant to the student. </p>
			<p>End user testers of various backgrounds both IT and non-IT savvy on various platforms will need to test both from the teacher perspective and the student perspective. Testing will allow for any bugs, roadblocks and unexpected results to be fixed up. We would most likely need to setup a user acceptance test form for testers to fill out so that there is a set standard of outputs that are tangible. </p>
