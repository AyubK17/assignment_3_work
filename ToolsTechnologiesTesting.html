                        What software or other tools are required by the project?<br />
                        <p>
                            To build QuickClass site we will use PHP and SQL database for Back End Development. Will be used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the Front-End application. For site design we will use Bootstrap elements and codes. The main tool for programming is Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 - an integrated development environment from Microsoft.
                            Another tool for connect SQL database and PHP code is XAMPP developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages.
                            Professional hosting <a href="http://www.domohost.com" target="_blank">www.domohost.com</a> will be used to host the site and connect the modules. The services of this hosting include all the services that we need. At the moment, the Business Hosting Plan costs 47.88 USD per year.
                            We will do a wide range of opportunities for communication between the user and the teacher. Live Interaction Sessions will be possible through popular programs like Zoom, Discord or built-in module in internet site.
                            To create an application for smartphones on iOS, one of the main languages of iOS development will be used Objective-C or Swift. The Android application development will be developed in Kotlin, which is an enhanced Java. To create applications in Kotlin, we need to have Android Studio 3.0 or later installed.
                            Machine learning is increasingly being used in modern programs and we will develop this algorithm for our program and will be applied in our program.  The algorithm of our program will predict with a certain accuracy what exactly the user will want to study next time.  Based on this assumption, the user will be offered a particular course or training videos.  The development of code for machine learning will be done using Google's machine learning framework - TensorFlow and Python.  We will create a software that will interact with the user and the user will have the impression that he is working with high level of artificial intelligence.
                            Payment process will be organised with APIs of finance companies or banks to build payment terminal in our website. Good example of that possible to find on https://developer.fisglobal.com/
                            The hardware we will use are a powerful computer, preferably two screens for comfortable coding. To develop applications for smartphones, we need to use an Android smartphone and another iOS smartphone. An internet connection is also required.

                       <h2><font style="color:darkblue;">Testing</font></h2>
                        The project will be tested in several stages. 
                        Initial testing will be at the stage of programming and 
                        connecting the database to avoid errors in the code. At this stage, 
                        there will be an initial check of the logical part and a check of the 
                        compliance of the program components with a predetermined plan. Initial 
                        testing will be performed by programmers who work on the program code.
                        The second check will be carried out after the end of the programming 
                        stage, connection of the database and the payment system. The second 
                        check will be carried out by members of our group and will consist in a 
                        complete simulation of the usage of the program for errors or logical inaccuracies. 
                        There will be some test payments for small amounts, deliberate changes to the data
                        in the database to test the response of the program, testing the program on various
                        platforms and browsers. At this stage, there will be 6 members of our group, each 
                        of us will test the program and start fill testing forms with the actions that he
                        performed and the result he received. After receiving the test results and correcting 
                        errors, the third stage of programming will be completed. Members of our group will
                        also participate in this stage, since they already know the past errors of the program 
                        and have experience in using all the components of the program. The participation of 
                        our group members in testing the program is necessary by the fact that we have knowledge
                        of software development coding methods and concepts.
