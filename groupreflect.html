					<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3>Liam's Reflection</h3>
					<p>
            As a team we have worked more cohesively than in the previous assignment, this is mainly attributed our changes to our minute taking processes and our clear definition of due dates at the start of this assessment period. Overall, we were more consistent on making the meeting times with no person missing more that 2 meetings, this allowed for more live discussion about how we each felt about what direction to take for the next portion of wark that had to be done. There was more varied contribution in the meetings as well, this was helped by splitting up the roles of the chair-person and the minute taker, allowing the chair-person to contribute more. By setting the guidelines that, anyone who misses a meeting must watch the recording and make comment in the group chat, made it so the person not in the meeting could be held accountable for not attending. As we have each be given specific parts to completed within this document, it has helped us stay organised.

          <h3>Xavier's Reflection</h3>
					<p>
            As an overall statement this assignment went more smoothly than the last. This is due to the group's ability to understand what worked and what did not work from the previous assignment. The group talked through our last feedback and concluded that what we needed to work on was communication. We started making sure as a team that our communication was better this time and this led to us having a lot more understanding of each other's situations and deadlines that needed to be met. There were a lot more interferences this time with individuals lives outside the project and this was only a minor issue, and not a fault of any individual. It did cause our meetings to be missing a member often. However, with our communication we were able to mitigate any issues that this could cause as we made sure there was an understanding on what needed to be done and what deadlines needed to be met. The groups willingness to support one another was a surprise and this was a great attribute to the overall cohesion and cooperation of the group. The thing I learned specifically about working in a group is that everyone is willing to support one another provided there is an understanding of the situation, and that communication is clear between the members.

					<h3>Maxim's Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            I believe the delegation of tasks was the most strong in this final task. In the very first meeting, each person elected themselves as the leader of certain sections in the document. This allowed us get to work straight away and finish a great deal of this document in a week or so. Once this was mostly completed we started works on the website and video presentation. I think one main area we could have strengthened was the use of the website Monday.com, I believe this tool is invaluable for project timelines, and I would certainly use it in the future. I am surprised at how smoothly this assignment came together, and how quickly it came together. We certainly all work well within a team now, and it has been a pleasure to meet the other members. I have learned how to operate well in Teams, and present myself within formal meetings, and I have also learned about my strengths and weaknesses in an IT setting which will help me moving forwards in my career. Once again, I believe the best reflection of our group activity has been the Microsoft Teams chat, and the meetings. Here is where all of the decisions were made moving forwards, and where the meetings were made and recorded. I was also able to drop in the presentation drafts into Teams for review by the other members which really made it quite easy.

          <h3>Aileen's Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            I believe we have grown closer as a group and are familiar with each other’s working and learning styles; this assists in working together with more flow and in a cohesive unit. Our communication skills have also improved in both our formal team meetings, as well as our members being more active in Microsoft Teams chat throughout the whole project. As a result, we are aware of where we are at in different stages of our assessment and able to rely on each other for helpful feedback and improvements on sections. <br>
            I think we could improve in our HTML skills if we had more time for the project. I believe all our team members are pretty capable technically to learn, experiment and implement code. Thru this skills, our website for QuickClass will have more features for prototype. <br>
            One thing that was surprising was the least amount of stress I felt throughout this assessment and assessment 5. This was achieved thru constant communication and clear plan thru tools like Monday.com. <br>
            I’ve learnt that our group are organised and commit to deadlines even with our various commitments for personal, work and other units.
          </p>

          <h3>Sergei's Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            I got a lot of experience in the development of joint projects in a group. <br>
            Our group was disciplined and hardworking, very good communication between group members.  Everyone helped to everyone and the opinion of each member was heard and appreciated.  Responsibilities were assigned to the topics of the project.  We met online twice a week and discussed the necessary steps for the successful completion of the project.  We had a very hard job as we had to work on three assessments at the same time and also had to complete modules of the studied subject.  But despite the heavy workload, we completed our work on time, and I think that it is very good.  For all the time of working in our group, I have learned to better communicate with the members of the group, I realized what joint work is about documents and a website. <br>
            I want to point out that everyone in our group was very focused on their part of the work, performed their task perfectly.  Each member of the group shared their knowledge and skills with others.  During the work on the project, I have learned to better understand web programming, and also some frameworks with which you need to work when building an Internet site.  It had also a good experience in order to learn how to distribute responsibilities between group members, depending on their knowledge and desires.

          <h3>Ayub's Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            This assignment was a true testament to our groups to the promise made in the last assignment of better and more open communications. This Assignment has made group work feel not only easier but more inclusive as more people started opening up, many people putting their hands up for parts of assignments whereas last assignment task would be delegated by the chairing individual which has lessened the stress for each individual in group exodus but made the group work more fun and practical. I loved the utilisation of the Microsoft team chats to ask questions as we navigate the assignment which helped us get started on Assignment 5 while doing the current one. I feel for future Assignments or projects the use of projectors to get better share screen alternatives would come in handy but is just a suggestion. However, the group work and team effort were done in a way that each individual was contributing even on days they could not come to meetings. I have learnt that the power of accountability to rewatch meetings even when people cannot make the meetings helped strengthen the group bonding.

				<h3>Group Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Communication has significantly improved compared to our assessment. Our primary communication tool is Microsoft Teams’ chat function, in which we are able to get instant messages across all our team members. We feel we are more open and transparent with the progress of our work and able to keep everyone informed should formal meetings be missed by any team members.<br>
          Being more active in chats on an almost daily basis allowed us to work more cohesively and ease the workload between the group. Most of our team members have felt less stressed and more focused on tasks needing to be done at specific deadlines we set for the duration of assessments 3 and 5. <br>
          Our problem solving and delegation tasks have also improved, which saw the workload evenly distributed to team members based on their strengths. The tool Monday.com also aided in giving a birds-eye overview of the workload that each team member had. Each member could update items on the list and provide insights on any work completed or hurdles faced. <br>
          We were also able to work in smaller group settings in these assessments. For example, we saw Sergei and Maxim work together well on the Quickclass website and presentation as we found common work seen in both assessments. Both of these members learnt that they are gifted creatively. <br>
          We could improve on spending more time at the planning stage at the beginning of the assessment. We saw some risks in planning week by week during this assessment, which could have resulted in problems not being identified earlier (fail fast, fix quickly), team members not producing work on time or possible work being overlooked. <br>
          One thing that was surprising was the way in which our team worked with significant autonomy and agreed on most areas of the assessment. We all had different ideas and were respectful in allowing each team member to communicate their ideas and vote as a group on paths and views we should take up and research. <br>
          Our Github repository is updated by all team members in this assessment to allow everyone to practise their HTML skills and work in a different collaborative way outside of our Microsoft Document hosted on Sharepoint. <br>
          As a group, we learnt that everyone is independent enough to do their own work without any micromanaging. We are able to come together to collaborate together on this assessment document. We have also found our team members are open to both providing constructive feedback to each other’s work and also assisting each other out on expanding on ideas.  <br>
