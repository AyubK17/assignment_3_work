					<h2>Roles</h2>

						<p>For the QuickClass to run well, there must be 6-7 primary team members monitoring and cooperating as one; this method of forming a Software development team is critical so that everyone has the essential duties for the project at hand. Because this endeavour necessitates not just time and experience, but also diversity, which is essential for excellent software development as many professionals can attest to. The main reason is that people from all backgrounds and walks of life may contribute new insights, which inevitably improves and favourably impacts all tasks to be done, since talent transcends gender, colour, age, and geographical location. The first member of the group will be a 'Product Owner,' which will be assigned to Aileen since this job demands the individual team member to have a clear sense of what the end product should look like as well as knowledge of the project and potential consumers. This role also demands Aileen to better understand client requirements while still being in the best position to manage the development team, which is a fitting role given Aileen's expertise managing a network of schools. The next role is the engineering manager who will be responsible for the successful development of the cycle tasked with monitoring progress, in charge of planning and implementing plans and marking deadlines for all members although this role does not the engineering manage to code it is ideal for the manager to have a competent background knowledge to oversee even the front and backend coding team there due to these requirement the role of engineering manager will be delegated to Liam who has experience in management with competent understanding of code and good interpersonal skills to carry out the task. <p/>
						<p>The next part would be the Software development team who are responsible for coding the Sofware set out by Aileen and required to meet deadline implemented by Liam, the Software developer team can consist of senior and junior developers dealing with mainly back end code and tackling logical problems found on the project this role is delegated to Ayub who will write up the good to the specifications of Aileen and Liam’s vision but will need to consult with Sergie as he has respectable amount of knowledge in a programming and coding viewpoint. For any software be a success there must be a major role playing in the UX and UI designs to make it appealing for end users this will be delegated to Sergei has his contributions in the Webdesign in the last project was invaluable. Furthermore, the project necessitates the use of a software architect to conduct daily, weekly, and monthly audits to check for safety and security vulnerabilities as well as to assess code updates. As the line of work of cyber security matches this function, this will be allocated to Maxim, with monthly meetings with Maxim, Ayub, and Sergei to discuss code updates and safety reinforcements. Finally, every good project necessitates the hiring of a quality assurance engineer, which will be delegated to Xavier, who will be honest enough to push for quality while also being efficient enough to spot bugs in the backend and front end and build detailed reports of improvements on a monthly basis.</p>
